# Hybrid-Power-Balance-Model-Random-Coupling-Model

This repository contains the core code for hybridizing the Power Balance Method and the Random Coupling Model, aiming to develop a highly efficient computation of the wave chaotic systems.


You can also find the code for assessing the coupling strength (aperture cross-section) between neighboring chaotic environments.
